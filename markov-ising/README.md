# Metropolis Algorithm for the Ising Model

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Metropolis algorithm** for simulating the 2D Ising model with periodic boundary conditions. The code measures the energy, specific heat, and magnetization as a function of temperature for lattices of different sizes, including \(4 \times 4\), \(8 \times 8\), \(16 \times 16\), and \(32 \times 32\). The results are compared with known exact results for validation, where appropriate.

## Functionality

### 1. Metropolis Algorithm

The Metropolis algorithm is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method used to simulate the behavior of a 2D Ising model. This implementation allows for the study of spin configurations on square lattices with periodic boundary conditions, where the temperature \(T\) is varied to analyze thermodynamic properties such as:

- **Energy per spin**: Average energy of the system as a function of temperature.
- **Specific heat**: Derived from fluctuations in the energy.
- **Magnetization**: Average absolute magnetization per spin.

The algorithm starts from an initial random spin configuration and iteratively updates the system by flipping spins based on the Metropolis acceptance criterion. The simulation is run for various temperatures to explore the behavior of the system near the critical temperature \(T_c\).

### 2. Energy and Specific Heat Calculation

The energy of the system is calculated at each temperature. From the energy fluctuations, the code also calculates the **specific heat** per spin, which is an indicator of phase transitions in the system.

### 3. Magnetization

The magnetization of the system is measured as a function of temperature for different lattice sizes. The average absolute magnetization is plotted to observe how it behaves across different system sizes, and how it changes as the system approaches the critical temperature.

### 4. Lattice Sizes and Temperature Range

Simulations are performed for the following lattice sizes:
- \(4 \times 4\)
- \(8 \times 8\)
- \(16 \times 16\)
- \(32 \times 32\)

The temperature is varied in a range suitable for capturing the critical behavior of the Ising model (typically around \(T_c \approx 2.269\)).

## Results

The following outputs are generated by the code:
- **Energy vs. Temperature**: A plot of the energy per spin as a function of temperature.
- **Specific Heat vs. Temperature**: A plot showing the specific heat per spin, which peaks near the critical temperature.
- **Magnetization vs. Temperature**: A plot of the average absolute magnetization per spin, showing how the system transitions from an ordered (magnetized) phase to a disordered (non-magnetized) phase as the temperature increases.

### Comparison with Exact Results

For small lattice sizes (e.g., \(6 \times 6\)), the results are compared to exact solutions for the Ising model, and the output is printed with at least 4 significant digits to verify the accuracy of the simulation.

## How to Run the Code

### Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`


### Running the Notebook

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `markov_ising_metropolis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells to execute the Metropolis algorithm and produce the results for different lattice sizes and temperatures.

### Output

- **Energy vs. Temperature** plots for different lattice sizes.
- **Specific Heat vs. Temperature** plots for different lattice sizes.
- **Magnetization vs. Temperature** plots for different lattice sizes.

### Limitations and Future Work

- **Larger Lattice Sizes**: Although the code supports simulations for larger lattice sizes, they require significantly more computational time. Further optimization could reduce the computational load.
- **Critical Behavior**: The current simulation captures the critical behavior reasonably well, but increasing the number of Monte Carlo steps or lattice size would provide even more accurate results near the critical temperature.

### Conclusion

This implementation provides a comprehensive analysis of the Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm. The energy, specific heat, and magnetization are calculated for different lattice sizes, and the results are compared with known exact solutions. The code serves as a useful tool for studying phase transitions in 2D systems.
